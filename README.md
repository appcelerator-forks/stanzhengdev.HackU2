Dominion Hack-U2

Welcome to Neighborhood Watch 

A pack of reckless motorists have invaded your neighborhood. Protect your neighbors as they cross the street by egging the cars before anyone gets hurt.

We had a lot of fun making this app at the Dominion Enterprises University Hackathon 2. If you want to help make the app better we'll accept pull requests
